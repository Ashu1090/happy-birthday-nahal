Place your custom assets here:

- images/
  - her-photo.jpg          -> main heart-framed photo on the landing page
  - memory-1.jpg           -> first gallery memory
  - memory-2.jpg           -> second gallery memory
  - memory-3.jpg           -> third gallery memory

- audio/
  - background-piano.mp3   -> soft romantic piano loop used as background music
  - gift-chime.mp3         -> gentle chime played when the gift button is clicked

- textures/ (optional)
  - flower-texture.png     -> if you decide to use custom flower textures later
  - cloud-texture.png      -> if you prefer image-based clouds instead of CSS clouds

- /assets/images/her-photo.jpg
- /assets/audio/background-piano.mp3
